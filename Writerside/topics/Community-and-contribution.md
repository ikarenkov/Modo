# Community and contribution

Modo is a community-driven project, and we welcome your contributions! Currently it is developing primary by
me ([Igor Karenkov](https://github.com/ikarenkov)). We
believe in the power of collaboration and are excited to see how you can
help us make Modo even better.

> Modo was started as a POC of state-driven navigation for Fragments by [Konstantin Tskhovrebov](https://github.com/terrakok). Then the support of
> Jetpack Compose was added by [Alexey Ershov](https://github.com/alaershov) and finalized by [Igor Karenkov](%ikarenkov_github_url%) (me). I've been
> developing Modo for a while and used it in my personal and work projects, so we with [Konstantin Tskhovrebov](https://github.com/terrakok) decided
> to
> transfer this project to my personal GitHub. Currently, I'm the main maintainer of Modo.
