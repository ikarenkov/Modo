# Community and Contribution

Modo is a community-driven project, and we welcome your contributions! Currently, it is primarily developed by
me, [Igor Karenkov](https://github.com/ikarenkov). We believe in the power of collaboration and are excited to see how you can help us make Modo even
better.

> Modo was started as a proof of concept for state-driven navigation for Fragments by [Konstantin Tskhovrebov](https://github.com/terrakok). Later,
> support for Jetpack Compose was added by [Alexey Ershov](https://github.com/alaershov) and finalized by [Igor Karenkov](%ikarenkov_github_url%). I
> have been developing Modo for a while and have used it in my personal and work projects. Together
> with [Konstantin Tskhovrebov](https://github.com/terrakok), we decided to transfer this project to my personal GitHub. Currently, I am the main
> maintainer of Modo.
